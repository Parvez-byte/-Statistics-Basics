        "  - The covariance value of 10.4 indicates a positive linear relationship between Exam Score and Hours Studied. As the number of hours studied increases, the exam score also tends to increase.\n",
        "  - The correlation coefficient (r) of 0.86 indicates a strong positive linear relationship between the two variables. This means that as the number of hours studied increases, the exam score tends to increase in a predictable and consistent manner.\n",
        "  - In conclusion, the results suggest that there is a strong positive linear relationship between the number of hours studied and exam scores. This implies that students who study more tend to perform better on exams."
